difference b/w sed and awk

"sed" it is stream editor it provides text processing and text substitution by command 
 
"awk" it is text processing and based on pattern matching 


k8's Architecture

control Plane(master node): overall state state of cluster, scheduling 
==========================

kube-api server : it is exposes the k8's API it is  frontend for k8"s control plane all communication happens b/w diff components (like nodes, control plane,
and user requests) 

kube-controller :  it is responsible for ensuring cluster desired state it asks kube -scheduler in which node pod should be launched

kube-scheduler: it is responsible for placing pods on available worker nodes based on resource like cpu and memory

etcd : it is distributed key-value store where all cluster data is stored (config,state,metadata)


worker nodes:
==============

kubelet: it is agent will run on each node. it ensures the containers are running in desired state. it communicates with the control plane.

kube-proxy: it manages network connectivity and load balancing for services. it ensure network traffic correctly directed to pods

container runtime: this software responsible for containerized application (ex: docker, containerd)
